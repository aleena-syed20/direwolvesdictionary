                <h3> Background </h3>
                <p> If you don't know the famous R + L = J theory by now, maybe you deserve a couple
                    "Shames" from a certain septa. Basically, Rhaegar Targaryan and Lyanna Stark are Jon
                    Snow's parents. Is it a little creepy that Rhaegar ran away with a 15 year old Lyanna when
                    he was already married and had two kids? I mean, who is to <i> really</i> judge (I do).
                    Although I am a supported of N + A = J (a post for a later date), this theory is as canon as one can get.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                <p> Now, there is a ton of evidence out there that supports R + L = J. I'll provide a list of 
                    resources that will sum up basically every mention of a pattern that suggests Jon's true parents. Below are 
                a few of the main points. </p>
                <i> Bed of Blood </i>
                <p> Dreams are often a way for characters to reveal certain secrets and events of their past that would otherwise be remained unsaid.
                    Ned Stark's innermost thoughts are often shown to readers in this way.
                Ned often dreams of being with Lyanna in her final moments in the Tower of Joy. He would dream "dark disturbing dreams of 
                blood..." (Eddard XV) when imprisoned for treason in King's Landing. Childbirth was a common cause of death at this time,
            and mothers would often bleed out. Lyanna most likely died from childbirth, but who did she give birth <i> to</i>?
            Jon, probably. </p>
                <i> Promise me, Ned... </i>
                <p> As Lyanna was dying, she pleaded with Ned for him to keep a promise. We as readers
                    do not know what exactly was exchanged between the two, but it has been suggested that Lyanna
                    told Ned to keep her son safe from Robert and those who sought to keep the Targaryan line extinct.
                    Ned also dreams of "broken promises" (Eddard XV). This could refer to Ned allowing Jon to be sent to the wall,
                    and now that he is imprisoned, in danger for being the son of a traitor to the king.
