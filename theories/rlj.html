                <blockquote> <i>Prince Rhaegar loved his Lady Lyanna, and thousands died for it. </i></blockquote>
                <h3> Background </h3>
                <p> If you don't know the famous R + L = J theory by now, maybe you deserve a couple
                    "Shames" from a certain septa. Basically, Rhaegar Targaryan and Lyanna Stark are Jon
                    Snow's parents. Is it a little creepy that Rhaegar ran away with a 15 year old Lyanna when
                    he was already married and had two kids? I mean, who is to <i> really</i> judge (I do).
                    Although I am a supporter of N + A = J (a post for a later date), this theory is as canon as one can get.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                <p> Now, there is a ton of evidence out there that supports R + L = J. Below are 
                the strongest points in support of this theory. </p>
                <i> Bed of Blood </i>
                <p> Dreams are often used as a way for characters to reveal certain secrets and events of their past that would otherwise be remained unsaid.
                    Ned Stark's innermost thoughts are shown to readers in this way.
                Ned frequently dreams of being with Lyanna in her final moments in the Tower of Joy. He would dream "dark disturbing dreams of 
                blood..." (GoT, Eddard XV) when imprisoned for treason in King's Landing. Childbirth was a common cause of death at this time,
                and mothers would often bleed out. Lyanna most likely died from childbirth, but who did she give birth <i> to</i>?
                Jon, probably. </p>
                <i> Promise me, Ned... </i>
                <p> As Lyanna was dying, she pleaded with Ned for him to keep a promise. We as readers
                    do not know what exactly was exchanged between the two, but it has been suggested that Lyanna
                    told Ned to keep her son safe from Robert and those who sought to keep the Targaryan line extinct.
                    Ned also dreams of "broken promises" (GoT, Eddard XV). This could refer to Ned allowing Jon to be sent to the wall,
                    and now that Ned was imprisoned for treason, is in danger for being the son of a traitor to the king.
                </p>
                <i> Winter (Rose) is Coming</i>
                <p> Blue winter roses are peak symbolism in ASoIaF. Whenever these are mentioned, Lyanna is not far off.
                    There are many examples to present, but the most intriguing in my opinion is what Dany see in the 
                    House of the Undying. In a whirlwind of visions, Dany sees "a blue flower [growing] from a chink in a wall of ice" (CoK, Daenerys IV).
                    This presumably depicts Jon, who is growing (or blossoming) into a man while in the Night's Watch at the Wall.
                    It would stand to reason that someone close to Lyanna would also be symbolized by a blue rose. 
                </p>
                <i> Why the long face?</i>
                <p> Jon is said to take after his father, with a long face, dark brown hair, and gray eyes. Westerosi genetics
                    strike again where families carry specific qualities that distinguish them from other houses. Well, it's useful
                    in this case because if Jon does bear a resemblence to Ned, he must have some Stark blood.
