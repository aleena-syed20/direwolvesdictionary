                    <h3> Background</h3> 
                    <p> Patchface was a slave from Volantis taken back by Steffon Baratheon, father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly. 
                        He was on board the ship that was destroyed by a storm that killed everyone on deck.
                        Patchface was found three days later, but was never the same, speaking only in riddles and
                        rhymes that most assume to be musings of a witless fool. However, many believe these rhymes to be prophetic, a 
                        power given to him by the Drowned God after being saved from drowning. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> Rhymes, riddles, and R'hllor</h3>
                    <p> Many of the jester's rhymes center around life under the sea.
                        It makes sense that Patchface would have something to say about that,
                        but some of these rhymes are quite similar to depictions of what the afterlife
                        is for followers of the Drowned God.
