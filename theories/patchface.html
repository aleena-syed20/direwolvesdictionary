                    <h3> Background</h3> 
                    <p> Patchface was a slave from Volantis brought back by Steffon Baratheon, father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly. 
                        He was on board the ship that was destroyed by a storm that killed everyone on deck.
                        Patchface was found three days later, but was never the same, speaking only in riddles and
                        rhymes that most assume to be musings of a witless fool. However, many readers believe these rhymes to be prophetic, a 
                        power given to him by the Drowned God after being saved from a watery demise. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> Rhymes, riddles, and R'hllor</h3>
                    <p> Many of the jester's rhymes center around life under the sea.
                        It makes sense that Patchface would have something to say about that,
                        but some of these rhymes are quite similar to depictions of what the afterlife
                        is for followers of the Drowned God. Asha Greyjoy, who has grown up Ironborn and is familiar
                        with the stories of the afterlife, recalls that "Below the waves the merlings hail their lord by blowing into seashells" (ADWD, Asha I).
                        Pathface also says that "Under the waves we will ride seahorses, and mermaids will blow seashells to announce our coming, oh, oh, oh" (ADWD, Jon XIII).
                        He sings that "Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers. I know. I know" (ACOK, Prologue), of course referring to fish.
                        Melisandre is spooked by these seemingly innocent musings, telling Jon "That creature is dangerous. Many a time I have glimpsed him in my flames. Sometimes there are skulls about him, and his lips are red with blood" (ADWD, Jon X).
                        It could be that this is R'hllor warning her of an opposing god's vassal and the potential
                        danger he poses to her goals of aiding R'hllor in the victory over the Lord of Darkness, the Great Other.
