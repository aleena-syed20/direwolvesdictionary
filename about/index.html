                <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Hello. </h3>
                <p> Are you still twiddling your thumbs waiting for <i>The Winds of Winter</i> to come out? Are you over 
                occasional updates by Martin once again letting readers know the book is in progress? </p>
                <p> Well, I don't really know what else to do in the meantime instead of making a compilation of theories
                    that fans have had time to develop and explore with the decade long hiatus of the series.
                </p>
                <p> Ranging from whether certain characters are actually dead, alive, and everything in between, I hope you
                    enjoy reading Direwolves' Dictionary.
